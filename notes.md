## Graphs

### Graph
data structure

### Vertex
vertex means highest point. each "node" is a vertex

### Edge
line
(u,v) denotes an edge connecting vertices

### Undirected
direction between vertices can go either way

### Incident
adjective; describes when an edge connects to a vertex; that is, an edge is 'incident' on a vertex when it connects to it.

### Adjacent
a vertex that is directly connected to another via an edge is called adjacent

### Degree
the number of edges on a vertex

### Path
is just the path of edges connecting two vertices

### Weight
an attribute associated with an edge e.g. distance

### Weighted Graph
a graph with weighted edges

### Shortest Path
in a weighted graph, the path between two vertices with minimum sum of edge weights, or in an unweighted graph, the path with fewest edges

### Cycle
when a path goes from a vertex back to itself through any route

### Directed, Directed Graph
directed means the edges are a one-way link. a directed graph is a graph with such one-way edges.

### Directed Acyclic Graph (dag)
a directed graph that has no cycles

### Weighted Directed Graph
a graph with one-way edges that also have weights, e.g. a city map with distances as weights and one-way strings.

### Leaves/Enters
is what a directed edge does to vertices; leaves one and enters another

### Out-degree
the number of edges leaving a vertex

### In-degree
the number of edges entering a vertex
